# **App Name**: PriorityFlow

## Core Features:

- Task Creation with Priority: Allow users to add tasks with descriptions and assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- Priority-Based Task List: Display tasks in a clear, sortable list, visually distinguishing priority levels (e.g., using color-coding or icons).
- Task Completion: Enable users to mark tasks as complete, removing them from the active list while retaining them for possible review in a separate archive.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neutral grays for the background and task containers to provide clarity.
- Accent color: Use a shade of teal (#008080) to highlight interactive elements and the selected priority levels.
- Priority color-coding: High (Red: #FF4136), Medium (Orange: #FF851B), Low (Green: #2ECC40) for clear visual differentiation.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for task descriptions and priority labels.
- Simple, intuitive icons to represent priority levels and task status (e.g., exclamation mark for high priority, checkmark for completed).
- A clear, list-based layout for tasks, with distinct visual cues for each priority level.
